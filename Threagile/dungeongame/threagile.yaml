  This threat model describes a simple REST service for solving the Dungeon Game problem.
  The service is containerized and consists of a Java backend and a PostgreSQL database.
  The primary assets are the game records stored in the database.

  - java
  - spring-boot
  - postgresql
  - docker
  - web-client

      Game records might be considered user-inputted data. The integrity of the results is critical for the service's function.
